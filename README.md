# Overview
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a signal in O(nlogn) time. The algorithm to compute the DFT directly runs in O(n2) time (Chugg, 2021). The DFT calculates a signal’s frequency spectrum (ScienceDirect Topics). In other words, the DFT shows which frequencies occur in a signal. As such, in graphing the DFT, one can see which frequencies occur most often in a signal, a practical use of the DFT. As such, all of this can be done quicker with the FFT, considering its faster running time than the DFT. Although Python’s Numpy package includes a built in FFT function, in this project, we implement the FFT function in Python, compare its results with the built in FFT function in MatLab, verify that it runs in O(nlogn) time, and use it to analyze average daily temperature data for six cities.
